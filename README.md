This is a simple project about books.
As a user you could register yourself in the site, search for your desired books and leave and/or see another's
users reviews about your favorite books.

I could use more facilities from flask, like flask-login but i did rather do things manually, 
since the project even restricted use SQL alchemy ORM.
Was a fun project.
